## Overview

This project is a robust data analysis tool designed to efficiently handle and visualize large datasets from CSV files and SQL datasets. The tool is built with a user-friendly interface and interactive features for real-time data visualization, making it perfect for users dealing with big data.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Plots**: Supports line plots, multi-line plots, scatter plots, and more.
- **Zoom In/Out**: Allows users to zoom in on specific sections of the plots for detailed exploration.
- **Data Upload**: Upload large CSV files for real-time data visualization.
- **Download Plots**: Export and download the visualized plots.
- **Plot Customization**: Adjust plot parameters such as colors, chart types, axis labels, and data ranges.
- **Data Filtering**: Filter data for specific ranges or conditions before visualizing.
- **Additional Features**: Support for applying mathematical equations to data.

## Front End

- **Tech Stack**: React JS (Vite) for a fast and optimized setup.
- **Responsive UI**: The interface is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Allows users to manipulate visualization parameters (chart type, colors, axis labels).
- **CSV Upload Feature**: Users can upload large CSV files for analysis.
- **Visualization Libraries**: Integrate powerful libraries like D3.js or Plotly for dynamic and interactive data visualizations.

## Back End

- **Tech Stack**: Node.js for the backend server.
- **CSV Parsing**: Efficient parsing algorithms for large CSV datasets.
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Capable of handling and aggregating big data in real-time.
- **File Handling**: Backend service efficiently handles large file uploads and processes data for front-end visualization.

## Functionality

### 1. **Zoom In/Out** 
   - Explore the details of the data by zooming in on specific sections of the plot.

### 2. **Download Plots**
   - Export and download visualized plots as PNG or other formats.

### 3. **Change Plot Parameters**
   - Adjust chart type, axes, data range, colors, labels, and legends.

### 4. **Data Filtering**
   - Filter data for specific ranges or apply mathematical equations before plotting.

### 5. **Scalability**
   - Designed to handle large datasets without performance degradation, supporting multiple concurrent users.

## Evaluation Metrics

### 1. **Loading Speed**
   - Time taken to load the application and render the initial visualization.

### 2. **Big Data Handling**
   - Efficient visualization of large datasets (e.g., 10MB CSV files) with minimal performance degradation.
   - **Loading Time for 10MB Dataset**: [To be reported after testing].

### 3. **Interactivity**
   - Responsive interactive elements like zooming, filtering, and parameter adjustments without lag.

### 4. **User Experience**
   - Simple and intuitive interface for ease of use by users.

### 5. **Scalability**
   - Performance remains consistent as the number of concurrent users or data size scales up.

### 6. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful handling of errors and exceptions with clear feedback to users.
